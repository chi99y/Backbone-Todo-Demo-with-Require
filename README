Description:
-----------
This repo contains a modified version of the Todo demo application originally written by Jérôme Gravel-Niquet and linked in the official Backbone.js website (http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/).  

The goal was to use Require.js (http://requirejs.org/) to organize the code into separate javascript code as seen in more traditional Object Oriented programming styles.  This way, we can explore the use of Backbone.js in a team oriented programming environment to develop more complicated web applications.
